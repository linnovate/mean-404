mean-404
========

This is to be used with the "modules" branch of mean.

See instructions here: https://github.com/linnovate/mean/wiki/Modular-Architecture-work to understand how to install the mean cli.

Once the cli is working from the root of the app do `mean install mean-404` and make sure you restart the app. 

The module will create a 404 page that looks at the angular routes and suggests the closest match based on their entered url.

!!Please note this is a very experimental module on a very experimental branch. Expect lots of pushes over the next days and weeks!!
